###### From the terminal...
> Forget the terminal commands? Go back [here](https://github.com/codebug-tech/week-1-A).
- Navigate to your `Desktop` using `cd`
- Make a folder named `week-2-B`
- Navigate into `week-2-B`
- Create three files inside `week-2-B`: `index.html` and `style.css`
- Open the entire week-2-B folder in sublime


###### HTML
- Click on the `index.html` file above. 
- Click on the "Raw" button to isolate the code
- Copy all of the code and paste it into your `index.html` file
- Open your `index.html` file in Chrome to see what you have

## Ok, let's code
> Here is the [link to the ppt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lbm6iyzjsrzz50b/week-2-B.pdf?dl=0)

#### HTML
- Add some appropriate text to the `<title>` tag
- Add two puppy tricks inside each of the `<li>` tags
- Add a `<p>` tag inside the `puppy-tricks` `<div>` above the `<ul>` that explains what you are listing
- Add a puppy image to the `<img>` tag. Forget how to do this? Just google "how to add an image html". 
    *Hint you probably will be using the url for the image you find*
- Add a puppy thought to the `<p>` tag
- Open your `index.html` in chrome

#### CSS
- Select the `<body>` tag to add a background color to your page. Make it a [hex color](https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&ei=c8MTWv_UDILcjwTngoz4Ag&q=hex+color+picker&oq=hex+color+picker&gs_l=psy-ab.3..35i39k1j0i20i263k1j0l8.1789.3075.0.3212.8.8.0.0.0.0.222.540.0j2j1.3.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..5.3.540...0i20i264k1.0.UzF9Vbe5x_8)
- Select your puppy image using it's `id` and set the width to something around `300px`. (Notice this automatically resizes the height of your image to scale)
- Select the `puppy-tricks` `<div>` using it's `id` then...
  - Put a thick solid colored border around it
  - Set the width to be about 400px
  - Change the background color of the `puppy-tricks` `<div>`
  - Add 10px of padding to it
- Change the color of the text in all of the `trick` `<li>`s
- Add some padding to the `puppy-tricks` `<div>`
- Make the `puppy-thought` `<p>` italicized and bold
- Answer the questions at the bottom of `index.html`

### CHALLENGE
- Center everything on the page
- Change the background color on the `body` to be a background image
